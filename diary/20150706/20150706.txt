today I will be wiring up the sensors and doing the first test of the new code. First, the sensors..

Plugged in the power first.

So going around the ring from orange cone, it goes:

cone color  ||  polling timing pin  ||  output polling pin

orange ||  P9_13  ||  P8_7
green ||  P9_14  ||  P8_9
green ||  P9_11  ||  P8_10
purple ||  P9_12  ||  P8_8

Double-checked the polarity of the power supplies for them too, now let's look at the best way to write the assignments in code:

var pollingControlPins = ["P9_11", "P9_12", "P9_13", "P9_14"];
var pollingReadDataPins = ["P8_07", "P8_08", "P8_09", "P8_10"];

should actually be:

var pollingControlPins = ["P9_13", "P9_14", "P9_11", "P9_12"];
var pollingReadDataPins = ["P8_07", "P8_09", "P8_10", "P8_08"];




loaded the code.. I still can't set the input pins properly, I should concentrate on that and reading the PWM, which is 0.016 KHz or 16 Hz. Which is fast enough to be able to load into an RC circuit with a period of say, 2 cycles of that and then read the value that way...

Or I could just read it using event binding via interruptCallback a'la:

root@beaglebone:~# cat test.js
var b = require('bonescript');
var inputPin = 'P8_07';
b.pinMode(inputPin, b.INPUT);
b.attachInterrupt(inputPin, true, b.CHANGE, interruptCallback);
setTimeout(detach, 12000);

function interruptCallback(x) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(x));
}

function detach() {
    b.detachInterrupt(inputPin);
    console.log('Interrupt detached');
}


which works when there's only one process competing for the port, but not otherwise. So let's kill those others:

# systemctl stop cloud9.socket
# systemctl stop bonescript.socket

weird, that hasn't made it work. Yet it worked from the browser...

Okay so PWM probably isn't the best idea for the input. I should be using analog, surely. Which means a voltage divider (simpler) and a different port than I'm soldered to.



Okay, so I'm going to do some research into connectors now.

So just header connectors, and enough 4-core wire with a thick enough gauge that voltage loss isn't an issue.


Female headers on cape, 4 pins per header, the holes in the middle of the cape are 11 x 14.
