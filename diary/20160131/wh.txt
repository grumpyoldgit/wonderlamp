So I have a logic analyzer now, just going to check the output of the sensor first, then I'll see if my existing RS-232 - uart does the job I'm looking for. With the raw data I'll be able to check to see if I can re-encode the netcat output too.


Trying it from os x first.

Okay that doesn't seem to work :) it shows up under usb3 but the software just says 'disconnected'.

Trying it from Windows..

Although actually maybe I just need to run the beta version.. yeah that connected. Ace.

So the beta version is WAAAAY better. And I've had to just invert the signal and boom, we get the R etc..


So let me just check to see if this serial port doobie sorts that out for us, in which case we could just have another plug-in component.

Yeah so that's beautifully inverted the logic for me which is great, but I haven't looked at the analog quality of the output, so I'll do that now with the scope.

Beautiful 3.3v signal, the noise is consistent with the noise I always get from my shitty scope :)

So I guess I'll pump that into the ethernet bridge at some point just to show that works. Not now though.
