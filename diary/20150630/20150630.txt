Adding one final sensor (four total now) before hooking them up to the prototype shield.

Aim is still the same as yesterday - to complete a working prototype before the end of the week.

Soldered up the headers on the proto cape.

Extension male/female leads are enough to get the sensors around the hula hoop to the board..

Just need male cables coming off it.

Hooking up the power hookup wires to the cape first.


Now the signal wires....


Hmm... looks like all I did to document the pins was take some pictures. So the +5V and GND being 1 and 2 and 7 and 8 respectively is easy to spot since the cape provides them for you, but the signal wires..

// node script for development purposes

var b = require('bonescript');

var pins = ["P9_11", "P9_12"];

pins.forEach(function (pin) {
	if (b.pinMode(pin, b.OUTPUT)) {
		console.log("able to set pin mode, initializing to zero");
		b.digitalWrite(pin, b.LOW);
	} else {
		console.log("unable to set pin mode");
	}

	b.getPinMode(pin, printPinData);
});

function printPinData(x) {
	console.log("completed setting pin mode");
	console.log('mux = ' + x.mux);
	console.log('pullup = ' + x.pullup);
	console.log('slew = ' + x.slew);
	console.log('options = ' + x.options.join(','));
	console.log('err = ' + x.err);
}

function pollPin1() {
	b.digitalWrite(pins[1], b.HIGH);
	setTimeout(function () {b.digitalWrite(pins[1], b.LOW)}, 1);
	setTimeout(pollPin0,5);	
}

function pollPin0() {
	b.digitalWrite(pins[0], b.HIGH);
	setTimeout(function () {b.digitalWrite(pins[0], b.LOW)}, 1);
	setTimeout(pollPin1,5);
}

pollPin0(); // kick it all off


So the script shows P9_11 and P9_12 being used to poll for signal. For each of those, there needs to be a pin for reading the output.

So I'll add to the polling pins (output from the beaglebone), P9_13 and P9_14.

For the reading (input to the beaglebone), I'll use P8_07, P8_08, P8_09 and P8_10.


Fitted the cape, and I'm out of time. Shit. Okay so probably two more nights on this before it's at least complete enough to know what's not functioning :)
