So today I'm just trying out the new USR-TCP232-T modules.

I want to know if they'll talk to the sensors well enough; if so then I'll draw a paper diagram of what the board to hook them up to will look like, and the case for it and how to mount it in the sensor hole, then if we decide it's the way to go I'll do a proper diagram.
