Previously (last week) made a new board - powered over ethernet and using a serial to ethernet bridge. See pcb/mark-ii.tar.gz.

Now he beaglebone becomes an entirely network-based head for the sensor data.

I've connected the TX port of the ethernet to serial bridge directly to the ranging pin of the sensor, and calculated that a single high bit will be enough to make it range, so I have to make them range in turn, taking network latency into account. Hopefully the network will go so fast that it can be basically ignored, and I can just do a very fast sub-second round-robin of all the sensors fast enough that they don't screw each other up.

If not, I'll have to experiment some more with how fast it can all be done.

The goals for tonight are: 

- formalizing the changes we made on the playa, and incorporating them into the codebase
- generalizing the number of sensors to allow for adding and removing them (keyed on IP address maybe? I guess I could use a class C)
