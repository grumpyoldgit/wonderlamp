 Today I will get the MIDI/OSC working and send rob the packet capture..

 Requires writing coffeescript, since it turns out that node-osc is really just a wrapper around osc-min.

   # added by bambam
  m : {
    representation : "midi"
    split : (buffer, strict) ->
      split = exports.splitMidi buffer
      {value : split.midiObject, rest: split.rest}
    toArg: : (value, strict) ->
      throw new Error "expected midi object" if (typeof value isnt "object" and value.type isnt "midi")
      exports.packMidiObject value
  }

is the type definition, now I need to write the parsers:

packMidiObject and splitMidi

Building osc-utilities.js from the .coffee file within osc-min requires calling the coffee compiler thus:

sfo-m-4.local ~/Documents/beaglebone/fs/root/node_modules/osc-min/lib$ coffee osc-utilities.coffee -c

And then I just deploy in the usual way and run in the usual way:

sfo-m-4.local ~/Documents/beaglebone$ . _deployFilesystemDirectoryToBeagleboneRoot.sh
root@beaglebone:~# node main.js --host 10.0.0.154 --port 12101


And that's generating plenty of MIDI events within the MIDI listener via the OSC bridge that Rob recommended.
