Final days of June, there's nothing like an early completion, and this is nothing like an early completion. Still, it's still June, so rock on.

Objective for today and tomorrow is to create a working prototype of sensors mounted on hula hoops.

On closer inspection I only have three sensors, so that might cause a problem. Still, I'll get cracking.

Let's start by mounting the sensors within the cones more solidly with the dremel and glue, then check that they still work.

Okay, I've glued together the base plate to the rest of the cone, drilled a hole for the wires and set the whole thing in hot glue.

Turns out you have to turn off the hot glue gun as soon as you're done doing that one part.

Next one I'll mount with a rubber ring twisted into an s-shape and using zip-ties onto the backplate.

Yellow is PW output, blue is RX polling / input.

The rubber ring mount just wouldn't sit flat. Let's try that again with smaller washers... in a while. Hot glue for now :) Actually, scratch that, I've been able to mount it using plastic screws over a single flat rubber ring. 

Mounted those two on the hula hoop and making a third now. This time back to the hot glue for mounting.

Got three mounted. And that's as good a time as any to stop for the night. Wow. Lots more nights needed!



Looking briefly at software: Looks like https://github.com/node-ffi/node-ffi can be used to call C functions from javascript, so that I'll be able to call liblo directly (or some derivative of it!).
